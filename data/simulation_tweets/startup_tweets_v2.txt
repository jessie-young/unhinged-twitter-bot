CEO is the worst job at the company. The best job is co-founder. More equity than any employee. More equity than most investors. Less responsibility than a CEO. Co-founders sleep better at night than CEOs.
Coinbase and Bloom Tech illustrate the dangers of starting a startup in a regulated industry. When I was a kid I used to think that regulators (and prosecutors) were merely trying to protect everyone. What other motive could they have? But boy are they not.
Everyone talks about the same companies every day. Uber. Google. Facebook. Tesla. It's corrupting our youth. Here’s how Silicon Valley misled an entire generation about startups and wealth (and what you can do about it):
The best early-stage founders are glorified customer support agents.
As you're building, find founders ahead of you in the process. Learn from each other. Share stories on progress and get honest feedback.
A red flag for me is when a founder is more focused on fundraising than anything else. I just see so many people that think the end all be all is getting an investor or VC.  And as soon as they raise, they are already focused on the next round. In my experience people mostly focused on fundraising often won't make it.  People that do make it are focused on their clients. On their team. On massive visions. On making profit and revenue. The ironic thing is that when you are focused on those things, that's when it's easier to fundraise anyway!
The bigger your startup gets, the slower it tends to move.  What are some practices and behaviors you have/done or seen to mitigate this?
I’ve worked with 30+ founders/execs over 12 years. What did they have in common? They were all intensely optimistic. With an almost delusional belief in their vision. Your belief is the foundation of achievement.
