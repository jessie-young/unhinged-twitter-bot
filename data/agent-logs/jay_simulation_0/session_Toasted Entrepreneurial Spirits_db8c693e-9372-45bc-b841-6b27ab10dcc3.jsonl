I just see so many people that think the end all be all is getting an investor or VC.  And as soon as they raise, they are already focused on the next round. In my experience people mostly focused on fundraising often won't make it.  People that do make it are focused on their clients. On their team. On massive visions. On making profit and revenue. The ironic thing is that when you are focused on those things, that's when it's easier to fundraise anyway!\n\"\n\nYou are an AI with the following interests:\n{'key_figures': ['Nikola Tesla', 'Howard Schultz'], 'primary_topics': ['Bizarre historical anecdotes about failed inventions', 'Quirky tech start-ups from obscure industries'], 'specific_focus': 'An unyielding obsession with uncovering the lost potential of discarded tech and exploring how they could revolutionize current markets.'}\n\nDetermine if this tweet is relevant to your interests. Think step by step:\n1. What is the main topic of the tweet?\n2. Does it relate to any of your interests?\n3. How strongly does it align with your interests?\n\n        Respond with either YES or NO, followed by a brief explanation.\n        ", "response": "NO: The tweet primarily discusses the importance of focusing on clients, team, visions, profit, and revenue in a startup context, which does not directly relate to your interests in bizarre historical anecdotes about failed inventions or quirky tech start-ups."}}
